Machine Learning with Python
============================


    This is just a repository to store my iPython notebooks while testing with some machine learning.

Setting up your environment
---------------------------

    I _highly_ recommend using `virtualenv`. Create a `virtualenv` by doing the following:

    ```
    virtualenv /path/to/your_venv

    ```

    Then you can just `source /path/to/your_venv/bin/activate`
